# 캐글 스터디

**목적**: 상위권 캐글러분들의 작업을 필사하며 전반적인 데이터분석방식과 지식을 얻자는 취지에서 만든 스터디입니다.

**출처**: 한국 그랜드마스터이신 이유한님의 '커널 커리큘럼'을 참고합니다.

(커널 커리큘럼 작성자 이유한님 - https://www.kaggle.com/youhanlee)

**방식**: 
- 주제를 골라 필사 3번 반복 (깃헙에 업로드)
- 3번 반복하며 어려웠던 점과 배웠던 점 정리 
- 주중 3개의 프로젝트 실시 (논의를 통해 양조절 가능)
- 주말 1번 줌미팅으로 서로 어려웠던점과 느꼈던점, 개선할점 공유
